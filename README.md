# Honest Calculator
 A Hyperskill Project
## About
The International Union Against Idleness (IUAI) announced a competition for an application that would motivate users. There are prizes involved. Since you like competing and know a little bit about programming, you asked your friend to prepare an interesting algorithm for a quick buck. Unfortunately, you weren't clear enough, and instead of a ready-made program, a friend prepared a flowchart of Honest Calculator. You will have to put some effort into assembling it.
